---

## 3. Research Evidence (`$rd-research`)

Use this when external evidence materially affects a feasibility study, technical proposal, standards task, detailed design decision, or fact-dependent review. Skip it for small tasks where the provided source material is sufficient.

```text
Use $rd-research

## Research Goal
{Decision, document section, standard clause, technology choice, policy question, or review claim that needs evidence}

## Downstream Use
This evidence will support: {rd-feasibility / rd-solution / rd-specification / rd-design / rd-writing / rd-review}

## Required Source Types
- Target project documents: {files or excerpts}
- Standards / policies / regulations: {if relevant}
- Vendor / framework / protocol documentation: {if relevant}
- Academic or technical literature: {if relevant}
- Market, cost, or industry cases: {if relevant}

## Expected Output
Produce a source table with authority, date/version context, relevance, confidence, conflicts, gaps, and citation-ready notes. Do not write the final downstream document yet.
```

Choose one primary research mode: {Evidence Support / Technology and Open Source / Configuration and Infrastructure / Fact-check and Argument Evidence}. For technology and configuration work, include exact product form, version, platform, environment, reproducibility status, security/privacy boundary, and rollback or exit-path evidence.

## 14. Multi-Document Delivery Orchestration (`$rd-delivery`)

Use this only when the user explicitly wants an end-to-end, multi-document, phased, or cross-session engagement. Route a single deliverable directly to its specialist Skill.

```text
Use $rd-delivery

## Engagement Goal and Authority
{decision or delivery goal, audience, scope, exclusions, success criteria, owner, approval authority, date/version boundary}

## Known Source-of-Truth Artifacts
{project guidance, baselines, PRD, evidence, feasibility, decisions, designs, standards, reviews, or existing task record}

## Required Deliverables
{only the artifacts needed; do not force every rd-* stage}

## Expected Output
Create a delivery charter, artifact/dependency map, decision-complete work packages with blocking edges, checkable phase gates, explicit artifact states, and a durable handoff that does not depend on chat history.
```

---

## 15. Greenfield Open-Source Landscape and Solution Gate

Use this only when a greenfield product or tool, or an unresolved architecture decision, would materially benefit from comparing external projects. Do not use it for small fixes or implementation under an already approved architecture.

For one solution deliverable, use `$rd-solution` and route external evidence to `$rd-research`. Use `$rd-delivery` only when the user explicitly requests research, provisional MVP requirements, solution selection, and an approval gate as a coordinated multi-artifact engagement.

```text
Use $rd-delivery

## Goal and Authority
I want to develop {product or tool}. The current controlling goal is an evidence-backed solution decision, not implementation.

## Research Boundary
- Perform read-only research and solution definition only.
- Do not modify the target project, create tracked or durable project files, emit implementation code, or begin implementation unless separately authorized. Return the decision package in chat by default.
- Temporary read-only clones under `.tmp/local/` are {allowed / not allowed}. If they are not allowed, state the resulting source-inspection limits.

## Needs and Constraints
{users, problems, core scenarios, fixed business constraints, security/privacy requirements, target platforms, budget/schedule limits, integration constraints, exclusions, and success criteria}

## Source Discipline
GitHub is a candidate source, not the sole authority.
- Record the inspection date and pin each material repository to a tag or commit.
- Check official documentation, source, releases, issue/PR maintenance, security notices, license, dependencies, and reproducibility evidence as applicable.
- Assess activity using release/commit recency, maintainer response, archive status, and unresolved critical issues; do not rank primarily by stars.
- Distinguish maintainer claims and static source inspection from reproduced runtime behavior.

## Candidate Analysis
For each high-value candidate, explain the problem addressed, architecture, major dependencies, extension and trust boundaries, current maintenance state, design worth reusing, design to avoid, applicability gaps, license/security constraints, and exit or replacement path.

## Required Decision Package
1. A traceable evidence table and candidate shortlist, including rejected candidates and reasons.
2. Recommended technology selection and strongest credible alternative.
3. System context, component architecture, data/control flows, trust boundaries, and key failure paths.
4. Provisional MVP scope tied to user needs, exclusions, assumptions, and verifiable acceptance conditions.
5. A dependency-aware implementation handoff sequence, major risks, validation gates, and unresolved decisions.

## Approval Gate
Stop at the approval gate after presenting the decision package. Implementation is outside the RD Skills' delivery boundary and must not begin without separate confirmation and an implementation-capable workflow.
```

---

## 16. High-Impact Bidirectional Argument and Critical Clarification

This is an optional preamble, not a standalone Skill. Prepend it to an applicable `$rd-requirement`, `$rd-feasibility`, `$rd-solution`, or `$rd-review` prompt only when a high-impact question involves a genuine disagreement over positions or options and an unresolved critical variable could materially change the conclusion. Do not use it for clear factual queries, small corrections, implementation under an approved solution, or other low-risk work.

```text
Before making the final judgment:

1. Preserve my original question and restate the objective as your "current interpretation." Separate the underlying need, my proposed solution, confirmed constraints, and unconfirmed assumptions. Do not invent an objective on my behalf.
2. Identify implicit assumptions and decision-critical evidence gaps, and explain how different values or findings could change the conclusion. First resolve facts discoverable from the supplied materials, the current project, or authoritative sources; do not ask me to retrieve information you can inspect yourself.
3. Give the strongest credible case for my current idea and the strongest credible, material counterargument, alternative explanation, or alternative option. Do not manufacture symmetry; if one side has materially weaker evidence, say so.
4. State whether the real disagreement concerns facts, definitions, objectives, values, risk tolerance, or decision authority, and identify the variables most likely to change the conclusion. If the current problem and evidence support it, identify one error or failure mode most likely to distort the judgment; otherwise omit it.
5. If exactly one unresolved decision that only I can make blocks the final judgment, ask only that question and pause. Otherwise, do not ask a question for form's sake; proceed with a bounded judgment, rationale, confidence, remaining uncertainty, and next action.

Do not expose hidden chain of thought. Output only the reviewable current interpretation, assumptions, evidence, counterevidence, key variables, trade-offs, and conclusion summary.
```

## Prompt Tips

| Tip | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Preserve raw source text | Keep the user's original requirement, clause, or document text intact before structuring it |
| Specify document type | PRD, feasibility study, technical proposal, high-level design, detailed design, standard, technical article, evidence report, decision brief, or review report |
| Provide upstream references | Link PRD -> feasibility -> proposal -> detailed design -> review for traceability |
| Use research selectively | Invoke `$rd-research` only when external evidence materially affects the downstream document or review |
| Demand evidence separation | Ask the agent to separate facts, assumptions, estimates, inferences, and unknowns |
| State review focus | Focused reviews produce higher signal than generic "please review" prompts |
| Use standards wording constraints | For standards, require clause references, replacement wording, and "requires human verification" where evidence is missing |
| Keep execution out of scope | Do not ask these skills to write code, run tests, deploy, or operate systems |
